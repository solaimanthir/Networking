* BGP(Border Gateway Protocol) is an open standard protocol and it is the routing protocol 
  which is used to route traffic across the internet.

* It is quite different from IGPs(Interior Gateway Protocol) such as OSPF, EIGRP, RIP.

* AS(Autonomous System) - A group of routers under a common policy and a single administration.
  when we enable BGP between two AS, it is said to be eBGP.
  And, when we enable BGP between routers within an AS, it is said to be iBGP.

* IGP protocols such as EIGRP, OSPF runs on top of IP. Protocol RIP runs on top of UDP.
  BGP works on top of TCP. 

* BGP packet types are OPEN(sets up adjacency), UPDATE(Advertises routes), NOTIFICATION(send an error
to BGP neighbor), KEEPALIVE.

* KEEPALIVE messages are sent every 60s. 180s is the dead timer value.

* BGP uses attributes as the metric.
  IGP protocols such as OSPF uses link cost as the metric, RIP uses hop count as the metric.
  For EIGRP, bandwidth and delay is the metric.

* BGP uses collection of attributes for metric. BGP has a total of 13-14 attributes.

* For iBGP, the adminitrative distance is 200. For eBGP, it is 20 only.
  This denotes that BGP is good between AS but not within the AS.

* iBGP neighbors need not be directly connected.
  When the iBGP neighbors send BGP packets, they send with TTL of 255.
  eBGP neighbors send BGP packets with TTL of 1(reason: for security purposes).

* Any bgp packet coming from addresses other than the configured neighbor(s) will be ignored.

* BGP is a slow protocol (needed so that it will not flood the internet with routing updates).

* BGP States: IDLE, CONNECT, ACTIVE, OPEN SENT, OPEN CONFIRM, ESTABLISHED.
