why multicasting ?
	* without multicasting, source has to construct and send packet to each destination.
	* with Multicasting, source will send data to a common multicast group.
	  Multicasting saves bandwidth because there is no multiple copies from sourcefor each destination.
	  And destination is only one multicast IP address.
	* Multicast IP range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255(class D address). Sender does not need to be part of multicast group.
	  Range of addresses between 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 is for use of routing protocols and other low-level topology discovery.
	  For discovery or maintenance protocols, scope is only for the link.
	  Multicast routers should not forward any multicast datagram with destination addresses in this range.

brief details about Multicast routing protocols:
	* PIM is the protocol to build necessary routing paths for receivers to get data from multicast group.
	* PIM builds routing table called MROUTE.
	* goal is to build path to reach all members of the group.
	* Routing protocol takes two approaches: source based tree(PIM-dense mode), core-based tree(PIM-Sparse mode).
	* source based tree:
		* Builds only shortest path tree for each sender.
		* Tree is built from receiver to the sender.
		servers will be flooding multicast signals. If the routers doesn't have receivers, pruning message will be sent by the
		received router.
		flooding and pruning occurs continuously. Not a recommended design.
	* core-based tree:
		* Builds a single distribution tree that is shared by all senders.
		* Selects one router as a core.
		No need to flood as senders register to the core only and receivers request to the core only for service.
		All other routers has to be configured with who is the core(rendezvous point).
	* PIM alternative: MOSPF. The caveat is that we need to run OSPF on all routers.

what is IGMP and how IGMP Protocol operates ?
	* IGMP is the protocol for joining Multicast communication.
	* IGMP is used by Multicast routers to keep track of membership in a multicast group. 
	* It operates on a single ethernet segment. RFC 1112.
	operation:
		* A host sends an IGMP report when it joins a multicast group.
		* A multicast router regularly multicasts an IGMP query to all hosts.
		* A host responds to an igmp query with an IGMP report.
		Query can be general or group-specific.
	*In networks with multiple Multicast routers, only one acts as querier and other routers as forwarder.
